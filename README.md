Designed a machine learning model which essentially can capture the breath recorded of any patient and classify him into healthy or a respiratory distressed patient (a total of 8 categories). The model was bult using state of the art technologies – Recurrent Neural Networks – Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Network. Both have accuracies close to 80% and can classify the recorded breath based with fixed 3 types of instruments. This is of great importance as the model could be integrated with phones, after training of high volume of data, which would be the most accessible respiratory classification methodology.
